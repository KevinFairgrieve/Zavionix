# Update 17/08/24:
# V2 widgets are getting released for beta testing.
# The V2 widgets are much lighter in graphics and CPU load. 
# Note: V2 widgets ONLY run on Ethos 1.5.0 and above ! 
In order to replace an existing widget with a V2 variant, the entire widget folder has to be deleted and replaced with the new one downloaded from Github.

# Installation
**For the exmaple we will discuss the RDT widget but all widgets are run in a similar manner**

1.	Widget files are compressed in RAR format. If you do not have a tool to extract the files please download Winrar for free from: www.winrar.com
2.	Extract the RAR files, inside it you will find a folder with the widget name (for example: RDT).
3.	Before you copy the widget to your radio SD card please bear in mind that Ethos needs version 1.1.0 and above to run widgets. If you have not yet installed this version you may do so by obtaining the files and installing them on your radio from the following link:
https://github.com/FrSkyRC/ETHOS-Feedback-Community/releases
4.	Copy the "RDT" widget folder to the SD card ‚Äúscripts‚Äù folder. If this folder does not exist on your SD card, please create a folder called scripts on the root of the SD.
5.	For example, for RDT widget, the SD should have a folder called scripts, inside it a folder called RDT and inside it the main.luac and all other files.
6.	**If you accidentally created any sub folders in the process, the widget will not work. So please make sure #4 and #5 are done correctly.**
7.	Once all files have been copied, start your Ethos radio.
8.	Go to screens menu (DISP button from main screen).
9	Add a new screen (screen 2 for example).
10. Choose screen layout. RDT needs FULL SCREEN (bottom most option): Note: Cells is the only widget that can be run on any size / part of the screen)
