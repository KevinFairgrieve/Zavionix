# Donations
***Many people have asked me for the price of the widgets.
My Widget designs are given for FREE as something to give back from me to the RC community which I love so much.
We put our heart and soul into these designs for modellers to enjoy, and to improve the Safety Of Flight and enjoyment from your models.***

***If you  like to send a donation to cover some of the huge amount of hours put into the development, it is always very appreciated 
and you may do so via paypal to ZavionixRC@gmail.com 
or directly via this [Donation Link](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=GEWL4TN8WEAKQ)***

***Thank you.***
